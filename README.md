# SkyMood
SkyMood is a minimal, Mac-inspired journaling interface where you reflect your current mood into the digital sky. Type a word that captures your emotion and watch it flow into your personal timeline â€” timestamped, preserved, and aesthetic.  Like clouds drifting in the sky, your moods deserve to be seen, remembered, and gently reflected.
